*Mic Drop is a tabletop rpg where the players follow a dumpster fire of a band on a train wreck of an album tour.*

The game is played as a dramatic story RPG, at table, but the players may interact with other band members (and fans) on social media as part of the game.

Craft a band persona and let the train wreck begin!

## Mic Drop is now in pre-order!

Pre-order Mic Drop now, and turn the speakers up to 11!

## Personae

* *The Backbone*: Part peacekeeper, part judge, part parent, as The Backbone, you keep the band on task and working as a cohesive unit. You're the voice of reason and structure.
* *The Writer*: You write 90% of the songs. Occasionally, somebody will contribute bits and pieces, but almost all of the glory (and blame) is on *your* overloaded shoulders. But nobody else has the chops.
* *The Hothead*: You embody pure physicality. "Poor Impulse Control" could be on your business card. Your emotions are way closer to the surface than most, but it makes for some damn tasty tunes.
* *and more...*
